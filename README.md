Instructor : Kunal Ghosh


# Task1 : Create GitHub repo. Install RISC-V toolchain using VDI shared over whatsapp group. Refer to C based Lab video and RISC-V based lab videos. Complete exact steps on your machine. Upload snapshot of compiled C code and RISC-V Objdmp on your GitHub repo



# Task2: SPIKE Simulation and observation with -O1 and -Ofast. Upload snapshot of compiled C Code, RISC-V Objdmp with above options on your GitHub repo. 



# Task 3: 1) List various RISC-V instruction type (R, I, S, B, U, J) after going through RISC-V software documentation 2) Identify 15 unique RISC-V instructions from riscv-objdmp of your application code  3) Identify exact 32-bit instruction code in the instruction type format for 15 unique instructions 4) Upload the 32-bit pattern on Github



# Task 4: Using Existing RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and testbench for functional simulation experiment. Upload waveform snapshots for the commands on your GitHub. Reference GitHub repo is here. 



# Task5: Update the repo with project name., Overview, Components Required to build your application, Circuit Connection, Pinout Diagram using ppt (current image is hand-drawn) and Table for Pin connection. Refer to this link for reference
